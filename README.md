<b> <b> Employee Performance - Project </b> </b>

<br>
The client expects the following insights from this project:

1. Department wise performances
   
2. Top 3 Important Factors affecting employee performance
 
3. A trained model that can predict employee performance based on factors as inputs. This 
will be used to hire employees

4. Recommendations to improve employee performance based on insights from analysis.
